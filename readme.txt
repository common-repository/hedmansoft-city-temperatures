== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How accurate is the information displayed for these cities? =
The accuracy of information is based on the accuracy of the weather stations at the location of the city you choose.  Also, the weather information is cached at the weather station itself (the cache timeout varies by station) and we also cache results in the plugin in order to save on metered API usage.
